On inspecting the .lua script, we see that the program listens incoming connection and checks the password via popen() function, in a subprocess.

In this sub-process, it uses echo to pipe the input password into sha1sum command.

To exploit this, we can send an input which will run as a command using command substitution.

First we need to connect to the server into the given port by the program using nc:
nc 127.0.0.1 5151

Then in the password prompt we type:
$(getflag > /tmp/flag)

A file containing the flag is created in /tmp!
