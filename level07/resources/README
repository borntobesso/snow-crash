on inspecting the executable with dogbolt.org, we see that the program getenv("LOGNAME") and then it echos its value using system() call.
we can manipulate the value of the environment variable so that it runs the getflag binary.
To set the environment variable to a literal string "$(getflag)", we use single quotes to preserve the literal value.
LOGNAME='$(getflag)' ./level07
on the running time of program, it will retrieve the value of the LOGNAME which is "$(getflag)" and then it runs 'echo $(getflag)', only to 'evaluate' the command in $() sytax and runs getflag binary.
