on inspecting the excutable, we see that the program expects a file and prints the content, except the files with name includint 'token'.
We suppose that the given file 'token' contains the flag.
As we don't have permission to the file, we cannot simply change the file name.
Alternatively, we can create a symbolic link to this file and give it to the program
ln -s ~/token /tmp/exploit
IMPORTANT when you give the path to the target file it has to be an absolute path
./level08 /tmp/exploit
