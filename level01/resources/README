cat ~/etc/passwd
we can see the flag01's encrypted password(42hDRfypTqqnw) directly (otherwise 'x'. The password hash and password expiry and so on.. are saved in /etc/shadow in encrypted form)
we can use John the Ripper (JtR) which is a popular password-cracking tool. 
install John (https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/doc/INSTALL)
run ../run/john [file with password to decrypt]
abcdefg
