the binary expects the UID of 4242 which does not exist (cat /etc/passwd | grep 4242)

we can trick the return value of getuid()

intercepting the register value during the runtime with gdb

to identify the memory address for the getuid() function: disas main

make a breakpoint to stop the process the moment of comparing values: b *[address] then `run`

on break point we can change the value of eax with command set: set $eax=[value] then continue with `next`
